Dim,Variable,Narrative
Resource Systems,Clarity of system boundaries - Clarity of geographical boundaries of TURF and reserves,"Individual TURF and reserve boundaries are explicitly outlined in official documents that include maps and coordinates. Reserve placement is decided by the community, and members trace reserve boundaries themselves. Fishers use GPS units and landmarks."
Resource Systems,Size of resource system - TURF Area (Km$^2$),IN = 889.5; ME = 353.1; PH = 299.7
Resource Systems,Size of resource system - Reserve area (Evaluated reserve area; Km$^2$),IN = 2 (1.3); ME = 10.48(0.09); PH = 11.25 (4.37)
Resource Systems,Age of reserves - Years since reserves were implemented,IN = 12; ME = 6; PH = 5
Resource Units,Number of units (catch diversity) - Diversity of targeted species,"Lobster is their main fishery of these three communities, but they also target finfish. Additionally, fishers from Isla Natividad target other sedentary benthic invertebrates (sea cucumber, urchin, snail, abalone)."
Resource Units,Stock status - Status of the main fishery,"Lobster stocks are well managed; along with neighboring cooperatives, the lobster fishery is MSC certified."
Actors,Number of relevant actors - Number of fishers,IN = 98; ME = 80; PH = 21
Actors,Isolation - Level of isolation of the fishing grounds,Their fishing grounds and reserves are highly isolated and away from dense urban centers.
Governance Systems,Property rights - Presence of institutions that grant exclusive harvesting rights,"Each community has exclusive access to harvest benthic resources, including lobster. These take the form of Territorial User Rights for Fisheries granted by the government to fishing cooperatives."
Governance Systems,Operational rules - Rules implemented by individuals atuhorized to partake on collective activities,"Fishers have rules in addition to what the legislation mandate. These include larger minimum catch sizes, lower quotas, and assigning fishers to specific fishing grounds within their TURF. They've established penalties for breaking these rules or fishing inside the reserves."
Governance Systems,Social monitoring - Monitoring of the activities performed by cooperative members and external fishers,"Fishing cooperatives have a designated group that monitors and enforces formal and internal operational rules. They ensure fishers of their fishing cooperative adhere to the established rules, and that foreign vessels do not poach their TURF and reserves."
Governance Systems,"Biophysical monitoring - Monitoring of biological resources, including targeted species","Every year since the creation of the reserves, along with Comunidad y Biodiversidad, fishers perform standardized underwater surveys in the reserves and fishing grounds. In more recent years, they have installed oceanographic sensors to monitor for changes in oceanographic variables (e.g. Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Salinity, pH)."
